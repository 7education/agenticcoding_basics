# Agentic Coding Basics

A practical guide for single developers adopting an agentic software development workflow with Claude Code (Opus 4.6). Shift from writing code to specifying intent, reviewing output, and making decisions.

## Contents

### [Agentic SDLC Guide](agentic_sdlc_guide.md)

A complete operating model covering:

- **The Agentic SDLC** — A five-phase cycle (Specify, Delegate, Review, Decide, Ship) replacing the traditional code-centric workflow
- **Skills** — How to identify, categorize, and mature repeatable tasks from manual to fully automated
- **CLAUDE.md** — Structure, templates, and anti-patterns for the persistent instruction file that gives Claude codebase context
- **Getting Started** — Week 1 checklist and maturity indicators for measuring adoption progress

### [Prompt Library](promt_library.md)

10 copy-paste-ready prompts for common development tasks:

1. Feature Implementation from Spec
2. Code Review & Refactor
3. Test Generation
4. Database Migration
5. API Endpoint Design & Implementation
6. Debugging & Root Cause Analysis
7. Documentation Generation
8. Security Audit
9. CI/CD Pipeline & DevOps
10. Legacy Code Modernization

### [Training Plan](training_plan.md)

A 6-month rollout plan for Engineering Managers introducing agentic workflows to their teams:

- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2):** Foundations — tool proficiency, prompt engineering, first agentic deliveries
- **Phase 2 (Month 3-4):** Process integration — redefined SDLC roles, spec templates, quality gates
- **Phase 3 (Month 5-6):** Scaling — reduced review overhead, parallel sessions, M-shaped contributors

## Quick Start

1. Read the [Agentic SDLC Guide](agentic_sdlc_guide.md) to understand the workflow
2. Set up a `CLAUDE.md` in your repository using the provided template
3. Pick prompts from the [Prompt Library](promt_library.md) and customize them for your stack
4. Run your first full cycle: Specify → Delegate → Review → Ship
